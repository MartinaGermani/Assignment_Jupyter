# Assignment_Jupyter
## Introduction
Starting from the third assignment of the RT1 course, I created a jupyter notebook to replace the user interface, which should allow to:
- autonomously reach a x,y coordinate inserted by the user,
- let the user manually drive the robot with the keyboard,
- let the user manually drive the robot using the keyboard but with some controls in order to avoid collision.
